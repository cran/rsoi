\description{
The Southern Oscillation Index is defined as the standardized difference between barometric readings at Darwin, Australia and Tahiti. The Oceanic Nino Index is average sea surface temperature in the Nino 3.4 region (120W to 170W) averaged over three months. Phases are categorized by Oceanic Nino Index:
\itemize{
\item Warm phase of El Nino/ Southern Oscillation when 3-month average sea-surface temperature departure of positive 0.5 degC
\item Cool phase of La Nina/ Southern Oscillation when 3-month average sea-surface temperature departure of negative 0.5 degC
\item Neutral phase is defined as when the three month temperature average is between +0.5 and -0.5 degC
